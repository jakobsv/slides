<ul>
<li>To get an insigt into the participatory practices in the everyday life of young people I have used the photo elicitation interview. This is an explorative method - it can explore themes and phenomenons that the researcher don't know on beforehand. The concept is that the participants are asked to make a photo journal of their everyday life and show what is important for them. Then the photo journal form the basis for a qualitative interview with the participant and the photos provide a structure of the interview. Until now 18 interviews have been conducted with youth between 14 and 18 years old from Holb√¶k Municipality - both young people who are political organised and young people who are not.</li>
<li>A <b>benefit</b> is that the method provides an entrance to how the political may be connected with everyday practices from the perspective of young people. The interview is structured by the photos from the youth - the youth decide what to talk about and how they want to present their every day life.</li>
<li>A 2nd benefit is that it shows how engagement and an interest in the world we live can exist side by side with political apathy. It shows the how the 'non-engagement' captured by surveys may actually be an engagement.</li>
<li>A 3rd benefit is that it shows how participatory practices is a differentiated and contexualised phenomenon. It helps connecting the research and theories of youth participation with concrete moments in everyday life practices - a specific moment containing time, space and sociality. The method can provide a bridge between analytical and statistical generalizations and concrete young peoples subjective experiences in concrete contexts.</li>
<li>There is a <b>challenge</b> with selection bias. The young people have to sign up if they want to participate and in this signup process it can be difficult to handle the selection bias. It's not a question of statistical representativeness, but about securing a broad range of experiences and backgrounds. The selection bias is a challenge for all data collection involving a signup process, but there is something in this method with taking pictures and talking about you and your everyday life is that is more appealing to some than others. I assess the broadness of socio-economic backgrounds to be ok, but I'm e.g. experiencing a gender bias. Out of 18 interviews I have 5 boys and 13 girls.</li>
<li>A 2nd challenge is the interview technique. Before the interviews I often only know their name, age, gender, where the live and eduction, and maybe they have sent their photo journal on beforehand. So the most of the questions get improvised during the interview. This is the case for many semi-structured interviews, but it's more distinct in this design because you basically don't know who you are talking with before the interview situation.</li>
<li>A 3rd challenge is to find the needle in the hay stack. Let's take a look on one of my dataset&#x2026;</li>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>This is my dataset containing pictures from the everyday life of my participants. And the good question is where to find participatory practices in all these different everyday life practices?</li>
<li>A good and bad thing with the everyday life perspective is that we can talk about everything. On the one side there is a lot of stories and experiences in all these picture providing an insight into the everyday life of young people. On the other side it can be difficult to assess what is relevant and what is not.</li>
<li>The explorative approach is like a like fishing trip where sometimes you get something on the hook and sometimes you don't.</li>

<p>
[&#x2026;] perhaps in the form of my silent protests. For example, after my school psychologist, where she called my parents bypassing me, I refused to use her anymore. Also, my psychiatrist - I was discharged because I don't think group therapy and medicine was a good idea. [&#x2026;] But I might consider, [&#x2026;] when I get it at a distance then just say: 'Hey, it wasn't really a very good experience I had here' or write a critique or write something.
