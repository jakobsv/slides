<ul>
<li>The first pitfall is to see young people's participatory practices as one generalized social phenomenon instead of seeing it as a class specific and contextualised phenomenon. A generalization could be 'the lazy youth' or 'the engaged youth' - but both generalizations ignore the class specific aspect of young people's political practices.</li>
<li>The second pitfall is to see young people's participatory practices as a dichotomous phenomenon where the youth are either engaged or disengaged instead of seeing it as a complex and dynamic phenomenon where engagement and disengagement exist side by side.</li>
<li>Sometimes it's difficult to say whether a specific practice is political or not. There can be practices that on the surface are apolitical, but below the surface something political is going on or is under construction. There can be young people who see themselves as not interested in politics but actually are doing something political.</li>
<li>The third pitfall is to see young people's participatory practices as a phenomenon observed with old categories instead of exploring it from the youth's point of view today.</li>
<li>We need to - as a complement to surveys - more explorative approaches with the use of young eyes where the political is not defined on beforehand.</li>

<li>A perspective from the youth</li>

<ul>
<li>To get an insigt into the participatory practices in the everyday life of young people I have used the photo elicitation interview. This is an explorative method - it can explore themes and phenomenons that the researcher don't know on beforehand. The concept is that the participants are asked to make a photo journal of their everyday life and show what is important for them. Then the photo journal form the basis for a qualitative interview with the participant and the photos provide a structure of the interview.</li>
<li>A <b>benefit</b> is that the method provides an entrance to how the political may be connected with everyday practices from the perspective of young people. The interview is structured by the photos from the youth - the youth decide what to talk about and how they want to present their every day life.</li>
<li>A 2nd benefit is that it shows how engagement and an interest in the world we live can exist side by side with political apathy. It shows the how the 'non-engagement' captured by surveys may actually be an engagement.</li>
<li>A 3rd benefit is that it shows how participatory practices is a differentiated and contexualised phenomenon. It helps connecting the research and theories of youth participation with concrete moments in everyday life practices - a specific moment containing time, space and sociality. The method can provide a bridge between analytical and statistical generalizations and concrete young peoples subjective experiences in concrete contexts.</li>

<li>20 young people from Holb√¶k Municipality between 14 and 18 years old have participated in the study - and they are a part of different youth communities.
<ul>
<li>All the particpants are a part of non-purposive communities: This is friendships and other communities without a specific purpose which</li>
<li>2 of the participants are a part of fandoms. This is communities who share a common interest in a specific cultural phenomenon, e.g. metal music or cosplay.</li>
<li>5 of the participants are a part of associations, e.g. sport or scout.</li>
<li>2 of the participants are a part of a local youth council which is faciliated by the municipality and 1 is former member.</li>
<li>2 of the particiapnts are a part of a youth party and 2 are former members.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>I think it's interesting to study political practices across these types of communities instead of just looking at one type of community. With the look across communities we can better see different experiences with the political. These experiences can be placed on a continuum between the latent-political and the manifest-political. Between the political as something hidden and not yet unfolded and the political as something declared and with a clear societal dimension. We can place the communities on this continuum but I will later discuss if this is the right way to see it.</li>
<li>With the pitfalls I talked about before, the latent-political praticies have been neglected in research and by municipalities and NGOs, but I try in my project to take a closer view on these practies because I think there is a political potential in these practices that maybe also can challenge what we normally see as political.</li>

<li>To unfold the polical I have chosen some analytical themes which is relevant to understand differences and similarities between practices with a potential political aspect - and the differences and similarities between the poltical in the youth communities I described before.</li>
<li>I will now present three of these themes:
<ul>
<li>Expressing ones identity</li>
<li>Using public space</li>
<li>Practising critique</li>

</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Expressing ones identity is about how the youth visually through cloth, tatoos, trinkets, etc. try to show other what is important for them.</li>
<li>These two pictures are the first pictures that Clara and Olivia show in the interview. Clara is a part of metal music community - a fandom - and show some festival bracelets. Olivia is a part of a youth party and show a tatoo with a socialistic symbol.</li>
<li>It's interesting that they both start the interview on the same way - with a photo that show a physical detail in their visual expression about who they are. The difference is that Olivia in the interview tell something about her political identity and Clara about her cultural and social identity.</li>
<li>But basicly it's the same image - is about appearing as a unique person and engaging in specific aesthetics. These expressions are not necessarily political, but they can be. Clara says later in the interview that some of her band t-shirts have statements and that the choise of apperance is related to something political or society.</li>
<li>This points towards an observation of fandom and youth party as two forms of subcultural expressions related to the construction of identity rather than an observation of one community that is political and one that is not.</li>

<ul>
<li>The similarity between fandom and youth party is also expressed in these two photos. Clara is also a part of a subculture called the furry fandom. It's about taking a character of an animal and then be that animal, e.g. get a costume and walk around in the public like the left photo. The right photo is Olivia participating in a demonstration in front of the national parliament against the masking ban.</li>
<li>Again we have one practice that - on the surface - is apolitical and one political. But again it basicly the same image: Two practices on using public space.</li>
<li>Clara's action is about making a difference for others and making a positive disturbance of a public space in Holb√¶k - the central shopping street which is dominated by comsumption and cars. Olivia's action is about telling the public that something is wrong with the rules that the parliament have decided. Both actions demonstrate a will to step forward in the public.</li>
<li>The two situations also both relate to the same societal event - the decison in the national parliament about the masking ban. These two practices are now perhaps ilegal and can be seen as a protest against some rules that limit individual freedom.</li>
<li>The difference is that for Clara the masking ban is a potential intervention in her lifeworld and for Olivia it's not something she is personal affected by. For Clara this action is something she just do, for Oliva it's a political action.</li>
<li>This points towards an observation that the same actions can be framed both as political and as apolitical - that all kind of youth communities move dynamic between the latent-political and the manifest-political.</li>

<blockquote class="citat">
<p>
[&#x2026;] perhaps in the form of my silent protests. For example, after my school psychologist, where she called my parents bypassing me, I refused to use her anymore. Also, my psychiatrist - I was discharged because I don't think group therapy and medicine was a good idea. [&#x2026;] But I might consider, [&#x2026;] when I get it at a distance then just say: 'Hey, it wasn't really a very good experience I had here' or write a critique or write something.

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>The last analytical theme is about practising critique. In the interview with Jonas we talk about his problems with depression and that he is not satisfied with the help he has got from the public sector. I ask if they can hear his critique and he answers&#x2026;</li>
<li>This is an example among other about critique from the young people about society. I perceive this as latent-political because it's critique formulated as an individual and private practice. There is an initation of something political with protests and writing things down but it's not sure that the instituions can hear this critique. This is not a communtiy practice, but there is a manifest-political potential if it was brough into the public. How can this potential be realised?</li>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Let's take a look again on the different youth communities.</li>
<li>The question I'm working with now is how individual problems among youth can be transformed into public critique and societal change. We improve our society through critique but which arenas do the youth have to practice critique? The participation in the youth communities that on the surface can be categorized as more manifest-political do not necessarily relate to the practice of critique.</li>

<ul>
<li>One way to see political practices among youth is as a staircase where 'true' political participation is realised in the party political system and where you become more and more manifest-political by stepping up to another type of community.</li>
<li>But my interview point towards the observation that we can't make any clear divisions between the latent-political and the manifest-political and that participation in a youth council or a youth party often not is connected to critical experiences but is more a search after a community where you can belong.</li>

<ul>
<li>So another way is to:
<ul>
<li>see the different youth communities' position on the continuum as dynamic rather than static</li>
<li>see the youth communities as different forms of youth cultural expressions where one community is not necessarily more manifest-political than another community.</li>
<li>see a political potential in a broad sprectrum of youth communities.</li>
