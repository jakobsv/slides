Young people in Denmark today are indifferent and lazy. They do not bother with politics and do not take responsibility for the development of society. This is assertions that we regularly encounter in the public debate. [&#x2026;] On the contrary, we are experiencing a generation of young people who are ambitious and committed - and fully involved in society.

<li>The first pitfall is to see young people's participatory practices as one generalized social phenomenon instead of seeing it as a class specific and contextualised phenomenon.</li>
<li>This quote from a report on youth participation demonstrates the pitfall. The actors by the report are a fund, a think tank and a NGO, and they say&#x2026;</li>
<li>The quote is an example of a statement that has been repeated in the discussion on youth participation for many years now. We get introduced to a generalization of the youth as lazy - and then next we get introduced to a counter-generalization - the 'engaged youth'.</li>
<li>So in the one generalization the youth reject the political institutions. In the other generalization the youth find new ways of political participation.</li>
<li>The problem with the reproduction of these generalizations - both 'the lazy youth' and 'the engaged youth' -  is that they ignore the class specific aspect of young people's participatory practices. They ignore the political inequality among youth. We can of course not say that a whole generation is "fully involved in society".</li>
<li>The actors behind the quote could be excused by the fact that they are not from academia. But on the other hand they are knowledge producers that play a role in how government, municipalities and NGO's frame youth participatory practices.</li>
<li>And they get inspired by the social sciences. For example in the quantitative literature about youth participation they get compared with other generations, and youth from different countries get compared with each other. This could lead to a conceptualization of young people's participatory practices as one generalized social phenomenon.</li>

<ul>
<li>The second pitfall is to see young people's participatory practices as a dichotomous phenomenon where the youth are either engaged or disengaged instead of seeing it as a complex and dynamic phenomenon where engagement and disengagement exist side by side.</li>
<li>This is an example from a survey about the the regional elections last year in Denmark where one of the questions was about political participation in general. Each of the variables are dichotomous, e.g. are you a member of a political party or not? It's also interesting that there is a variable with "don't engage". So as a respondent you have the possibility to say yes to one or more of the variables above, and if you say no, then you "don't engage". Of course you can answer "other", but that possibility don't capture the latent-political, and it's difficult to think outside the box defined by the other possible answers - they limit the political imagination.</li>
<li>Sometimes it's difficult to say whether a specific practice is political or not. There can be practices that on the surface are apolitical, but below the surface something political is going on or is under construction. There can be young people who see themselves as not interested in politics but actually are doing something political. It depends of course also on how you conceptualize the political.</li>

<li>The third pitfall is to see young people's participatory practices as a phenomenon observed with 'old' categories instead of exploring it from the youth's point of view today.</li>
<li>This is the variables regarding political action in EVS. It's interesting to see the historical development of political action but the challenge here is that the political action is defined 37 years ago, and maybe something has happen since then. E.g. occupying building is more a participatory practice of the 70's than of today.</li>
<li>Of course the purpose of EVS is to see the historical development of values and not to give a complete picture of today's values and actions. But the example show that it can be difficult to look with old eyes on new practices, because the political get reformulated for in each generation. And maybe the old eyes are not trained to see something new.</li>
<li>We need to - as a complement to surveys - more explorative approaches with the use of young eyes where the political is not defined on beforehand.</li>

<li>To get an insigt into the participatory practices in the everyday life of young people I have used the photo elicitation interview. This is an explorative method - it can explore themes and phenomenons that the researcher don't know on beforehand. The concept is that the participants are asked to make a photo journal of their everyday life and show what is important for them. Then the photo journal form the basis for a qualitative interview with the participant and the photos provide a structure of the interview. Until now 18 interviews have been conducted with youth between 14 and 18 years old from Holbæk Municipality - both young people who are political organised and young people who are not.</li>
<li>A <b>benefit</b> is that the method provides an entrance to how the political may be connected with everyday practices from the perspective of young people. The interview is structured by the photos from the youth - the youth decide what to talk about and how they want to present their every day life.</li>
<li>A 2nd benefit is that it shows how engagement and an interest in the world we live can exist side by side with political apathy. It shows the how the 'non-engagement' captured by surveys may actually be an engagement.</li>
<li>A 3rd benefit is that it shows how participatory practices is a differentiated and contexualised phenomenon. It helps connecting the research and theories of youth participation with concrete moments in everyday life practices - a specific moment containing time, space and sociality. The method can provide a bridge between analytical and statistical generalizations and concrete young peoples subjective experiences in concrete contexts.</li>
<li>There is a <b>challenge</b> with selection bias. The young people have to sign up if they want to participate and in this signup process it can be difficult to handle the selection bias. It's not a question of statistical representativeness, but about securing a broad range of experiences and backgrounds. The selection bias is a challenge for all data collection involving a signup process, but there is something in this method with taking pictures and talking about you and your everyday life is that is more appealing to some than others. I assess the broadness of socio-economic backgrounds to be ok, but I'm e.g. experiencing a gender bias. Out of 18 interviews I have 5 boys and 13 girls.</li>
<li>A 2nd challenge is the interview technique. Before the interviews I often only know their name, age, gender, where the live and eduction, and maybe they have sent their photo journal on beforehand. So the most of the questions get improvised during the interview. This is the case for many semi-structured interviews, but it's more distinct in this design because you basically don't know who you are talking with before the interview situation.</li>
<li>A 3rd challenge is to find the needle in the hay stack. Let's take a look on one of my dataset&#x2026;</li>

<li>This is my dataset containing pictures from the everyday life of my participants. And the good question is where to find participatory practices in all these different everyday life practices?</li>
<li>A good and bad thing with the everyday life perspective is that we can talk about everything. On the one side there is a lot of stories and experiences in all these picture providing an insight into the everyday life of young people. On the other side it can be difficult to assess what is relevant and what is not.</li>
<li>The explorative approach is like a like fishing trip where sometimes you get something on the hook and sometimes you don't.</li>

<li>Let's zoom in on one of the practices. This picture show a girl who is a part of a subculture called the furry fandom. It's about taking a character of an animal and then be that animal, e.g. get a costume and walk around in the public like here. I think an interesting question is what the societal and political aspect is of this subculture? I think it's a good example for this practice is probably something that wouldn't have been captured with 'old' categories of civic engagement and political participation.</li>
<li>On the one hand the girl can be categorized as apolitical <b>[1st quote]</b>. So this not in her own view this is not a societal or political engagement.</li>
<li>But on the other hand it is an example of what we maybe can call a public virtue - a desire to achieve the public good, a desire to enter the public, to care about world. <b>[2nd quote]</b> I probably overshoot the mark by calling this an example of public virtue, but I think there is something under construction here.</li>
<li>What she says though, is that there could be relation between this practice and then societal issues by the society's regulation of this practice. <b>[3rd quote]</b></li>
<li>She mentions the masking ban or the burka ban as something that has an influence on her practice. More than a week ago this was a legal act but from 1st of August wearing a suit like this became illegal - or maybe illegal - it's a bit difficult say. But if she wears it today it could more directly perhaps be seen as a political protest against some politicians that tries to limit her freedom.</li>
<li>So this an example of a practice where an engagement in world exists side by side with something that on the surface is a political disengagement. The learning point from this example is that the interesting thing with participatory practices in the everyday life of young people is not to judge what is political or not, but to explore what could be political.</li>
